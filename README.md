## Description

A recipes website was created with the homepage containing links to the individual recipes. 

The user can browse through the available recipes in the homepage, and <a> tags were used to create links to each of the available recipes. Once the user clicks on a link, the user is taken directly the specific dish's recipe page. The recipe page contains an image of the dish with an alt attribute (in case the image cannot be loaded or the user uses a screen reader) as well as a short introduction of the dish using <p> tags. 

The description section then follows with two types of lists: unordered and ordered lists. Since ingredients can be listed without a particular order, unordered lists were used to list the ingredients while for the steps ordered lists were used. For more complicated dishes, the ingredients section was broken down into multiple lists for organization and readability.
