                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol class="recipe-steps">
                    <li>Soak the rice cakes for about 20 minutes (can be longer for refrigerated rice cakes).</li>
                    <li>Cut the fish cake, cabbage, and scallions into about 2-inch long pieces.</li>
                    <li>To a large pan, add the dried anchovies, dried kelp, and onion along with 5 cups of water. Bring it to a boil over medium high heat, and continue to boil for 10 minutes. Reduce it close to medium if your heat is very high. Remove the anchovies, dasima and onion from the broth.</li>
                    <li>Add the sauce ingredients to the pan, stirring to dissolve the red chili pepper paste (gochujang).</li>
                    <li>Add the rice cakes. Boil until the rice cakes become very soft and the sauce is thickened, about 8 - 10 minutes. This can take longer, depending on your rice cakes. Stir frequently so the rice cakes don't stick to the bottom of the pan.</li>
                    <li>Drop the vegetables, garlic, and fish cakes in. Continue to boil, stirring occasionally, for an additional 4 - 6 minutes. Depending on rice cakes, you may need more time to reach a desired level of softness. Add more broth or water as necessary. Drop in the scallions and boiled eggs with 2 to 3 minutes remaining. Taste the sauce, and adjust the seasoning if needed. Serve hot.</li>
